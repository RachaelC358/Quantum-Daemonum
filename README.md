# Quantum Daemonum 

A simple game where you play as as a wicked spirit in a battle with
Van Helsing who has harnassed the power of a quantum simulator. Van 
Helsing will attempt to guess your true name in an attempt to gain 
power over and and defeat you. Fight to stall the computer and win
using magic spells.

This game was designed to test Grover's algorithm, which runs on the
quantum simulator and can find an object in an unordered list faster
than on a classical computer by putting qubits in superposition.
