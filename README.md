# Quantum Daemonum 

A simple text-based game where you play as as a wicked spirit in a 
battle with Van Helsing, who has harnessed the power of a quantum 
simulator. Van Helsing will attempt to guess your true name in an 
attempt to gain power over and and defeat you. Fight to stall the 
computer and win using magic spells.

This program runs using IBM's Qiskit framework for quantum computing.
The game was designed to test Grover's algorithm, which runs on the
quantum simulator and can find an object in an unordered list faster
than on a classical computer by putting qubits in superposition.
