Quantum Daemonum 
A simple game where you play as as a wicked spirit in a battle with
Van Helsing who is played by a quantum computer. Van Helsing will
attempt to guess your true name in an attempt to gain power over and
and defeat you. You can attempt to thwart him with spiritual attacks
that can either weaken his ability to guess or hide your name entirely.
