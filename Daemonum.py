# Quantum Daemonum 
# A simple game where you play as as a wicked spirit in a battle with
# Van Helsing who is played by a quantum computer. Van Helsing will
# attempt to guess your true name in an attempt to gain power over and
# and defeat you. You can attempt to thwart him with spiritual attacks
# that can either weaken his ability to guess or hide your name entirely.
